I'm Deo. This is my first blog post (okay, I probably didn’t need to mention that).

**Fun fact:** I ran track in high school — and Google loves showing off the two worst times on my record.  
If you're curious (or just need a confidence boost), here's the [link](https://www.directathletics.com/athletes/track/7611467.html) to what I am talking about.

**Fun fact:** Okay maybe not fun — but the first 5 months of 2025 were definitely the most challenging period of my life. That said, I have grown a lot.
I've learned a lot through this season: about letting go, showing up better for the people I Love, and how to refocus on what truly matters.

Anyway, enough of that.

I recently graduated with my bachelor's in Computer Science.

I love hacking things — by things, I mean computers and systems.

Right now, I'm focused on sharpening my skills, contributing to open source, and preparing for roles in infrastructure, backend, or machine learning.

Long term, I plan to finish my Master’s in Machine Learning and Computing Systems, and build tools and research that improve life for millions — maybe even billions of people.

I promise, this will be the only blog that will sound like this. Next time I will have something a bit more technical and interesting to read.

Thanks for reading this!
